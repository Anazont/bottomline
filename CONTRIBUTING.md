  Use four spaces for indentation. No tabs.

- **Naming**:<br>
  Keep variable and method names concise and descriptive.<br>

- **Quotes**:<br>
  Single-quoted strings are preferred to double-quoted strings; however, please use a double-quoted string if the value contains a single-quote character to avoid unnecessary escaping.
